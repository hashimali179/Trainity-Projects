**DATA ANALYTICS PROCESS**

Example: Predictive Maintenance for a Manufacturing Company

1. **Plan:** The manufacturing company wants to reduce unplanned downtime of its production line due to equipment failure. It decides to implement a predictive maintenance program.
2. **Prepare:** The company collects data on the performance and maintenance history of its equipment, as well as environmental factors that may affect equipment performance (temperature, humidity, etc.). The data is cleaned, formatted, and integrated into a centralized data repository.
3. **Process:** The company uses statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to process the data and identify patterns and relationships that can be used to predict when equipment is likely to fail.
4. **Analyse:** The company analyses the processed data to determine the factors that are most important in predicting equipment failure and builds predictive models based on those factors.
5. **Share:** The company shares the results of the analysis with relevant stakeholders, including maintenance technicians and production managers. The predictive models are integrated into the company's maintenance management system.
6. **Act:** The company uses the predictive models to schedule proactive maintenance activities, reducing the likelihood of unplanned downtime and improving equipment performance. The company continually monitors the results of the predictive maintenance program and adjusts the models as needed to ensure that they continue to provide accurate predictions.

This example shows how the data analytics process can be applied to real-life business problems and how it can help organizations make data-driven decisions.
