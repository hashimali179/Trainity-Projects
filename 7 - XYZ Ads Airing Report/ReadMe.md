**Insights :**

1. _What is Pod Position? Does the Pod position number affect the amount spent on Ads for a specific period of time by a company? (Explain in Details with examples from the dataset provided)_

Pod Position refers to the placement of an advertisement within a pod or block of TV commercials. For example, if there are five ads airing during a commercial break, the pod position of a particular ad would be its rank within that group of five.

In general, pod position is believed to be an important factor in the effectiveness of TV advertising. Ads that air earlier in a pod may be more memorable and have a greater impact on viewers, while ads that air later may be more likely to be skipped or ignored.

In conclusion, Brands spent more in Q1 of 2021 than Q4.

One reason might be because of 2nd wave of COVID 19 in India which led to many causalities as well as markets were highly affected.

1. _Conduct a competitive analysis for the brands and define advertisement strategy of different brands and how it differs across the brands._

Mahindra & Mahindra spends highest on new vehicles which is why the amount spent on Mahindra Thar is the Highest.

![](RackMultipart20230403-1-udvqh9_html_391d23a5820620d6.gif)

Out of total no. of ads, 97% of ads are of Mahindra Thar, 2% of Mahindra XUV 700 and only 1% of Mahindra Scorpio

The amount spent on broadcast network is way higher than cable. Whereas other brands don't have this much gap. This means that Mahindra does NOT believe in traditional way and invests in new technologies.

![](RackMultipart20230403-1-udvqh9_html_cb19628a28e19afd.gif)

There's a fall in the % of ads of Scorpio and XUV 700, there reason here might again be second wave of COVID 19. Mahindra stopped spending money on old vehicle but kept spending on THAR.

There is a relationship between the number of ads and the amount spent. I have used an exponential trendline to analyse this data.

My recommendation for 2022 ads campaign:-

Based on the analysis of the TV advertising dataset, it is recommended that Mahindra focuses its advertising efforts in 2022 on the target audience that is most likely to be interested in the new Thar. Specifically, the data suggests that Mahindra should target outdoor enthusiasts and adventure seekers who value off-road capabilities and performance. Given the high level of spending on Thar advertising, it appears that Mahindra is already aware of this target audience and sees potential for growth in this segment. However, in order to fully capitalize on this opportunity, it may be necessary to tailor advertising messages and channels to effectively reach and engage this target audience.
